# Webjam Year Recap 2021

ðŸ”– Overview

Everyone has now heard how bad the last ever Youtube Rewind was. Then general lack of recaps since then has been another disappointment in our lives. However, Spotify did a fantastic job with their recap for the year, as always. With this stark contrast in mind, it's time to take the mantle into your own hands and think of how you would recap the previous year. A little nod to 2021, to start your 2022 better. You could recap memories of traveling, your emotional phases, maybe even your experience with the webdev discord in the past year: anything goes.

And as is our new tradition, the challenge this time is to work on transitions. Focus on how you can transition from one thing (possibly a memory) to another, maybe something like power-point slide transitions like linear or gradient wipes, or perhaps an auto scroller. If you are targeting 3d, this becomes a whole new world to explore (See https://museum.xbox.com/). The possibilities are endless: that is precisely what WebJam has tried to bring about last year, and plans to do the same this year! Happy new year, everyone!
